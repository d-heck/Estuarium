- Added Organism Class
	- Added AquaticOrganism (Subclass of Organism)
		- canSwim = true
		- canWalk = false
	- Added LandOrganism (Subclass of Organism)
		- canSwim = false
		- canWalk = true
	- Added PlantBasedAnimal (Subclass of Organism)
		- canSwim = false
		- canSwim = true
	Purpose:
		The Organism class is broken into three subclasses which can be used
		to differentiated between the types of organisms being used.
		
		This was done in order to help with the placement and management
		of organisms in the view class later on.

- Added Level Class
	Purpose:
		Basically the brains of the model.
		Can generate a list of organisms that we use in the level.
		Can also play the level. AKA run the game instance in that level.

- Changed Model Class
	Purpose:
		Just runs the game w/o the need of a view. Not really super important.
		Not sure if this class will actually be used in the future or not.
