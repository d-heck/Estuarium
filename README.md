# Estuarium
A Simple estuary game made in java swing.
Created for DNERR, the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Estuarium is a simple "in or out" estuary game created to help children
understand what does, and does not belong in an estuary environment.

The game is designed to be able to implement as many estuary environments as possible,
as well as any creatures who may inhabit said environments.
